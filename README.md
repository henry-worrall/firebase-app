Aim
----------------------
To learn about some of the features of Firebase, a google backed product (essentially now a google product), which provides a ton of really cool features as part of a back-end as a service. E.g. it allows for cloud hosting for java apps, out of the box analytics, A/B testing, and loads more.

I'll think about sharing the link to the web app, however, the database that the app directly accesses is still in test mode, so I'd rather have randomers messing around with it. The changes to the environment settings have not been committed for similar reasons.
